  "description": "A calculator that approximates the calculations and graphics required for the daylight evaluation setback method in the NYC Zoning Resolution.\n\nThis calculator currently does not take reflectance calculations into consideration, nor does it handle the modifications available in 81-661 for the Grand Central Core Area.\n\nThis calculator only handles rectangular lots with 4 horizontal and vertical sides. If an irregular lot is given, it will use the bounding box of the site as your lot.\n\nWhen following the example in the zoning resolution, most of our score numbers differ in some way from what is shown. Where possible, we made decisions that would yield a more conservative score.\n\nThis is an estimator and is not intended to guarantee compliance. This function has no affiliation with the NYC Department of City Planning.\n\nThis is a work in progress: if you run into any errors, please contact serena@hypar.io\n\nThis function is the result of a collaboration between Serena Li and Luis Felipe Paris. If you would like to help contribute, please reach out!",
